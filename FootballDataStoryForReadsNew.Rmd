### to use this function, we pass in two arguments -- the dataframe name and the column we want to group_by() - use this for any/every column to make sure there aren't weird holes or suprising numbers of repeats or NAs

### ex: grouper(dataframe, "column_name")
grouper(downfieldog_4corners, "player_id")

# data ed does not think it's a good idea to compare the sums of 3 other 2021 players and 1 2022 player. I understand Deonte Banks just plays more than the other 3 so a player to player comparison is also tough, which I think is reason enough to drop this visual comparison completely. It just doesn't hold up.

# sentences in the story that use this code block below:

They played 410 coverage snaps in 2021 compared to Banks' 384 in 2022. The latter's were much more impressive. The three corners in 2021 allowed catches on 57.4 percent of targets, a mark dramatically higher than Banks'.

The three combined to give up 420 yards, break up four passes and only force six incompletions. Banks, meanwhile, gave up just 258 yards, broke up eight passes and forced 13 incompletions.

# sentence that uses this chunk

One of the main keys to Hemby and Littleton’s success out of the backfield was their ability to break tackles and extend plays through contact. Hemby racked up 525 yards after contact on the year while Littleton averaged nearly four yards after contact per rush for his 77 carries.

While Maryland didn’t get over the hump against either the Buckeyes or Wolverines this season, the Terps showed sizable improvement when analyzing the box scores for each game. 

Here, I took how much the average margin of victory/defeat for each of: Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan and Michigan State from 2014-2021 and put it next to the 2022 average margin. All of the box scores can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7QIXsMtkmARjHliLg1RcPNn9-CpEu-W2JO774cO6LM/edit?usp=sharing
